When the symptoms really started getting bad that's when my dad's doctor ordered an MRI and we learned that the frontal part of his brain was shrinking and in atrophy.  For my dad, from diagnosis to death it took less than two years, a year and nine and a half months to be exact.    As another poster mentioned I wrote a journal of everything he went through and it was challenging for sure as my mother and I were his caregivers the entire time.  If there was one blessing it was that he never lost his memory of who my mom and I were so that was a good thing.  I could write a book here on what we went through with this disease but almost seven months since his passing, I wish I could take care of him for just one more day.\")\n",

Bascially I am her punch bag and it is soul destroying. If you haven't already get a PoA and do what you have to do without them making it harder for you. If day to day tasks become impossible to complete then get home help for assistance or check your LO into a care facility. There comes a point when the stress and aggravation is just not worth it. They have dementia what do they know? Many times I feel like my mother is frying my brain and it literally hurts my head and I just want out. Can't do it any more, but I am trapped and she knows it because as well as having dementia she is a manipulative selfish narcissist which is a terrible combination. Get help is all I can say. Trying to deal with contentious issues on a one to one basis with a LO who is resistant non compliant is, 99% of the time, going to fail.\"\"\")\n",
