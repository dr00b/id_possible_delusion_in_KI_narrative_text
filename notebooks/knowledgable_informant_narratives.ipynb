When the symptoms really started getting bad that's when my dad's doctor ordered an MRI and we learned that the frontal part of his brain was shrinking and in atrophy.  For my dad, from diagnosis to death it took less than two years, a year and nine and a half months to be exact.    As another poster mentioned I wrote a journal of everything he went through and it was challenging for sure as my mother and I were his caregivers the entire time.  If there was one blessing it was that he never lost his memory of who my mom and I were so that was a good thing.
