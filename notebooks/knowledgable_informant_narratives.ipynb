       "12275  I worked in a nursing home when I was younger and it was a bit different to others, in that if we had a patient with dementia and their partner had the option to also move in with them. One patient I nursed PERSON her husband PERSON lived with her they had a twin room and he was with her all of the time as well as group activities but he didn''t want to be apart from her at any time. \\n\\nTheir story was actually truly tragic they had two children and lost one to a drowing when they were 20 and the other to cancer at 42 meaning they had no immediate family left, so they were one anothers everything. PERSON died aged 86 and PERSON survived her by 2 years. I had the privilege of going with PERSON for his wife's funeral so got to say goodbye to her properly. \\n\\nPERSON had no care needs when he moved in with his wife and minimal care needs when she passed away and chose to return to the home and live out his life in the place he and PERSON had spent the last ten years of their marriage. This home is in the UK and I was happy during my time there and was relieved at how well the people were looked after and I know it is not always the case even in the UK we have horror stories of elderly abuse and it always breaks my heart to hear it.\n",

If you’re “Betty” and your friend says you didn’t call earlier then you didn’t call earlier. If it’s Tuesday and you arrive at your parents house having last seen them on Friday but they are certain they saw you this morning then they are correct. All you do by arguing is confuse them, they won’t remember later why they were confused but they’ll remember that they were confused. They might not remember they saw the grandkids at one o’clock but they’ll have positive feelings that something happened earlier that made them feel happy and that is enough.\\n\\nI’m in my thirties, I don’t have dementia but it runs in my family, I’ve accepted there is a high chance that I’ll get it when I’m MUCH older, I’d rather spend my last years in blissful ignorance than confused panic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

It took a visit from a go between who on a visit said to her 'he thought they got it wrong'  Just before lockdown and a planned meeting at family court the go between attended a pre court meeting to remove power of attorned and harm mate she rang him and he said the case was dropped as it was not warranted.  No apology from safeguarding as shoddy social workers rang the job she had to leave due to the situation telling them she was on safeguarding.

       "3174   My Mom, who has Alzheimer, and has been staying with me, because my Dad is in the hospital.   Not only does she has Alzheimer, she is severely hard of hearing.  We have tried for at least 10 years for her to get hearing aides.  My Mom has tried a few different types of hearing aides for a short time, but will not use them.  My last try was to just get her a hand held amplifier, with ear buds.  She used it for a bit, but will not use it either.  It is really hard to do any of these really great tips that Dr. PERSON is suggesting, when everyone has to shout really loud at her to just hear basic things.  Mom cannot hear a conversation or it is hard for her to be a part of a conversation, because one cannot have a conversation continually shouting at her...it get's exhausting, and my voice gets hoarse. Although she has had two assessments at the geriatric clinic over several years; which they all agree she has Alzheimer, and I agree as well; I can't help but wonder how much is it the Alzheimer, and how much is it the hard of hearing, that is causing her not to understand. I was wondering if anyone can help or have some tips to help me out?                                                                                                \n",

He recognized his parents in the photos, and we were quite shocked. My grandpa can't even recognize my dad (his son) and my uncles, but when we showed him a picture of my dad when he was a very young child, my grandpa suddenly started talking abt my dad and saying things like \"he's a good boy.\" Suffice to say, there was a lot of emotion that day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "4678   The part where she did the Dementia/Alzheimer made me cry because it reminded me of my grandma who sadly passed away this January two weeks after her daughter's passing (my aunt). When I saw this video, it reminded of what my grandma did, she would accuse someone stealing and entering her house even though it wasn't true then she made up a story that we somehow believed lol then we will have a cycle of her asking the same question over and over again and revert back to her old attitude. As years passed from her diagnosis, she would have a hard time remembering us and her children's name but she tries her best and calls us random nicknames. What got us really emotional is despite that, she would repeatedly tell her old tale memories which happened in her last moments. It's been months but my heart aches missing her yet I know she's in her happy place with my grandpa and two kids.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

My great wife worked full time and put her life with me on hold so I could do this for him. As my father went through all the stages of the disease I was so glad my mom was gone before him, I do not believe she could have watch it happen to him. It was the PERSON thing I ever had to do. There were days I felt as if my heart was going to stop with the unbearable weight of sadness that was upon me. I had my dad with me for 6 years before he was at rest with my mom. I remember the joy and sadness I felt when he went home. It took months for me not to wake up and run to see if he was ok after he was gone. I still feel guilt that maybe I could have done better for him but I did the best that I could. He was always feed, clean and cared for. But I guess we who have gone through such A horrible disease with our loved ones always feels that way.

       "5976   This is amazing! My mom is a baby boomer. She turned 70 last year .I noticed in the last 2 years she cant hear as well and she repeats stuff she told me a week ago,a say ago,a few hours ago like she never told me . I dismiss it alot because it reminds me of my nan ( her mother) when she started doing the same thing and she wound up in a home with alzheimers. Luckily we now have video games or app games that test her memory and she is very tech savvy for her age. Bubble witch saga and candy crush are her favourite games. She can still drive but relies more on my stepfather to drive at night as she has a degenerative eye disease in one of her eyes that is more bothersome at night or bad weather driving. But she would love this place because she was born in 1949 and remembers all these diners and cars from her sisters and brothers.❤                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "2984   It’s criminal that doctors do not study food as a healer! My mom is 94 with dementia living in a memory care unit. She actually made it to 90+ before she was unable to live in her assisted living apartment on her own. She never necessarily had the best diet, but it was better than any food she ever got in any of the places she has lived. The food is passable, but over processed, over cooked, over sweetened, etc., etc. She spent a few days in a rehab (nursing home) facility after a fall and the food was unrecognizable! Seriously - I could not tell what it was they were serving her. The food where she is now is pretty good, but nowhere near the kind of healthy it needs to be. And they always serve desert after every meal! Not fruit, not nuts or seeds, but cake, pie, pudding, etc. Nobody ever talks about nutrition! Thank you and I hope you can push your peers to talk about this more!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

To my Mom, laziness and no note from any Dr. - illness is invalid. \\nThe lectures I received and still receive are exhausting. I had to stay away for 2 weeks for my health.

Don't lie to your mother. haha  :)  \\n((Hugs))                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "77     I'm about to say some lie about Tylenol PM having a recall, or being out of stock because my MIL keeps requesting it, and her son keeps buying it no matter how many times I say to stop. I know she isn't my mother, but I know damn well she is not supposed to be taking anything with Diphenhydramine. I don't want to lose her earlier than she already has. I adore her, and respect her dignity.

When I tried to remind him who I was, his youngest brother's daughter the look of confusion on his face was frightening.  Their history truly becomes there here and now, their current time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "823    This was so extremely helpful I have kind of thought my husband could have dementia over the last year he forgets everything he never knows what day, month, year we are in he will ask me 50 times a day is it time for the kids to come home our kids get picked up by  the bus but he meets them at the bus stop so right after he gets home from taking them to the bus stop he starts asking me if it's time to go pick them up it pretty much every 5 to 10 minutes  all day until 3 pm its mentally taxing on me.  But the one thing you mentioned is psychiatric issues can be misdiagnosed and really it could be dementia  which makes so much sense  its only been  a year that I thought we were dealing with dementia but he has been dealing with psychiatric issues for 14 years its all so much clearer so he has been treated with medication for psych issues and it was probably dementia all along and it just got worse over the last year thank you for helping to clear this topic up for me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "4136   Great video as usual! I'm currently wondering even about going to the opthalmologist because I'm not sure that my wife with FTD will be able to respond properly to their instructions when they're flipping the little lenses and asking her to read the letters on the wall, etc. Considering that I have to keep explaining to her over and over what an egg is, I just don't know if that's going to be worth the effort.  I do, of course, want to be sure that she can still see clearly, but one of the big problems with dementia is obviously that things that \"normal\" people do routinely can be very difficult. What if I tried to take a little Russian lady who spoke no English to the opthalmologist; how would that go?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "1521   I am glad I took the time to watch this today. We had a hard time last night (again) with my mother-in-law with PERSON. It's sad, we had a great, calm, easy day and every night when we get our 4 children to bed, and we are EXHAUSTED, she starts up. She accuses us of leaving her alone all day in \"isolation\"! We spend every extra minute with her and she is Never Alone! It is so hard. If it isn't that she finds all kinds of off the wall things to complain about, accuse us of and complain of being tired and wanting to go to bed. We try to redirect or distract her but it doesn't last long. When we try to take her to bed she says she isn't tired and doesn't want to.

       "4185   When my mom talks to her doctor she downplays her symptoms and does not tell the doctor the truth.  I think she believes what she is saying is correct but it is not.  The doctor spends more time looking at the computer screen than looking at her, so the doctor fails to pick up on any subtle clues.  My stepdad is more vocal and tries to provide additional information but my mom says he wants to control her.  I have seen my mom scream and yell at him and accuse him of stealing money from her checking account, which is not true.  I stayed with her for one month in her guest room and it was awful.  She accused me of ruining her life and I thought she was going to hurt my cat.  I feel like she has multiple personalities at times.  You never know who you will meet.

So  that  leaves  me  to  believe  that  there  are   a  lot  of  elderly  patients  either  being  left  unbathed  or  the  workers  are  just  hosing  them  down  as  they  sit  naked  in  a  chair.\\n\\nThis  is  video  is  not  realistic.   When  my  mother  was  alive,  she  had  dementia  and  you  couldn't  even  mention  that  you  were  going  to  put  water  on  her  head,  let  alone  her  whole  body.   I  have  one  sister  that  she  would  allow  to  do  it  for  her,  but  even  then  it  was  very  difficult.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "3541   I didn't care what others thought about my decision.  I cared that my husband wanted me 24/7 and when I couldn't physically do that  and he did go to memory care, that he was scared and more confused without me.  He had a stroke on top of being in the end stages of dementia, but the stroke rapidly sped up the disease.  I was able to care for him for about 6 weeks after the stroke, but he wandered, was physically strong, fell a lot, and was aggressive with the caregivers I hired to help me at home.  Nothing worked. He is deceased.

Answering the same question again simply relieves you of trying to find some other subject to discuss.  So,  i. This way, it is sort of a blessing\\n\\nTip four—\u0000put it o. A calendar or sign.\\nI write a note that Mom keeps PERSON of her to references and ruminate on over and over again as she tries to absorb the content\\nThis also helps with potentially argumentative issues.   My mom sometimes could not agree that this is her house, or that we are alone\\nSo, when she was more with it... I wrote a note with this information and had her sign it\\nThen,  when I show her the note it is not me arguing with her\\n\\nWhen my mom was a teacher, she had an ah ha moment to realize that children have different modes of learning\\nAnd that some children might absorb information better by hearing, others by writing, others by practical experiences \\nIt is the same information, but different pathways in the brain\\nAnd my mom definitely responds differently to hearing vs reading                                                                                                                         \n",
