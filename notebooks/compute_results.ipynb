    "That said, the model signficantly outperforms a naive bayes classifier built using a TF-IDF vectorizor, which ends up classifying all comments as negative class. This suggests the value of embedding and transformer-based models for this use case. Embeddings in this case are important in that codify a relation between words with similar meanings that may be important to the classification, for example \"think\", \"convinced\" and \"believes\". Transformers are likely useful in that contextual cues underlying the classification may span several sentences, rather than just a 1-2 tokens."

    "\n",
    "### Conclusions\n",
    "Without considering the relevance of the excerpt to a possible delusion classification, the model performed well in extracting excerpts that were actually found in the original text. In some cases, it's arguable that the model made improvements by correcting spelling, or inferring the referenced entity's pronoun when it was ommitted. However, it seems perferable to extract an exact excerpt and use deterministic methods to clean it up from there. Notably, the GPT series are know to correct themselves when errors are explicitly pointed out. Hence, it may be possible to use a function to identify excerpt extraction errors, and ask for a new result... Definitely a confusing computing paradigm!"

It's only because of the PERSON pandemic that he still lives where he is. Nursing home is next, but in Canada they don't want anyone who's trouble, in other words they don't care about the elderly in Canada. I love my father, but for his sake, while he still knows who we are I hope he goes peacefully in his sleep. Imagine being in a place, not remembering who we are, or even if we were just there, and abuse is rampant in Canadian nursing homes. I make little money, so I'm basically powerless.

       "      <td>My poor mother has had MS since age 32 and lived alone. She had an electric scooter and was fiercely independent. In 2015 she was transferring from the scooter to the couch and broke her leg.  She healed up and went to rehab but never really got back to the same level of independence.  She had filthy hair and stank of urine.  She would run off any caregivers we hired.  My brother came to her house to meet a tech to install internet so we could view and talk to her on camera and make sure that she was safe.  He found her lying on the floor by the scooter in a puddle of pee.  Shed fallen and spent the night there.  We got her to sign herself over to an assisted living home.  She was sad and angry at first but ended up making friends instead of being stuck alone in a house, stinking of poop and pee.  \\nMom has since been moved to the Memory care section. She never drinks enough fluids even when begged to do so, and she has had 2 heart attacks and several urinary tract infections.  Still, she is clean and better cared for than in assisted living.

       "913   My father has it, it's awful we had to sell his house and most of his stuff, he's currently in a seniors residence but they want him out. My sister has him at her place during the day, but that's not working as he gets what's called sundowning. I'm afraid he's going to hurt someone or the police are going to hurt him . It's only because of the PERSON pandemic that he still lives where he is. Nursing home is next, but in Canada they don't want anyone who's trouble, in other words they don't care about the elderly in Canada. I love my father, but for his sake, while he still knows who we are I hope he goes peacefully in his sleep. Imagine being in a place, not remembering who we are, or even if we were just there, and abuse is rampant in Canadian nursing homes. I make little money, so I'm basically powerless. He already forgets where he is, doesn't remember seeing us in the very same day, he doesn't wash, and fights and tries to get people out of their cars because he thinks there his. This is brutal.                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1089  Wow what a great video about dementia.  I lost my mother 5 years ago to dementia.  All of this makes so much sense. I learned to talk about right now . I never would tell my mom no. Instead I would say when she wanted me to take her \"home\" that I had to bring the car around and then leave. It was so hard and broke my heart to actually lie to her but it was the best I could do. She would of forgotten by the time I came back but still. Unfortunately for me I was going thru an illness that I no longer could work. .I didn't feel like driving.as much.. So I started calling her every morning. That worked out but I still tried to go see her.  She was about 1 1/2 hours away. My mom got very bad before she passed. She would be up all night and was trying to get out but luckily she was in a very secure place and they took very good care of her. I recommend anyone with a loved one with dementia to watch this or really anyone who want to know more about dementia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "405   Oh my gosh - I was very new to nursing and had a lovely lady who asked me when her husband was going to visit. Sadly he had been dead for quite a while and in my wish to be truthful, told her so.  How I wish I hadn‚Äôt.  She became distressed and couldn‚Äôt believe I would tell such a cruel lie.  I never made that mistake again. Just a few minutes later, she asked the same question - thankfully this time I said simply ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming in a bit later.‚Äù  I felt bad for lying but saving her from that moment of distress made up for that.

       "49    My poor mother has had MS since age 32 and lived alone. She had an electric scooter and was fiercely independent. In 2015 she was transferring from the scooter to the couch and broke her leg.  She healed up and went to rehab but never really got back to the same level of independence.  She had filthy hair and stank of urine.  She would run off any caregivers we hired.  My brother came to her house to meet a tech to install internet so we could view and talk to her on camera and make sure that she was safe.  He found her lying on the floor by the scooter in a puddle of pee.  Shed fallen and spent the night there.  We got her to sign herself over to an assisted living home.  She was sad and angry at first but ended up making friends instead of being stuck alone in a house, stinking of poop and pee.  \\nMom has since been moved to the Memory care section. She never drinks enough fluids even when begged to do so, and she has had 2 heart attacks and several urinary tract infections.  Still, she is clean and better cared for than in assisted living.  Her old friends come and visit.  She remembers them but has 1 or 2 delusions a month, usually where she is going out to eat and driving herself.   \n",

My best friend is suffering from early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs &amp; going through your videos really helped me understand her situation a lot better. \\nI don‚Äôt live close to my friend, but am in contact with her wonderful husband through  phone calls &amp; texts. Today we spoke &amp; my heart broke for him. He is exhausted beyond belief between work, taking care of my friend &amp; raising their autistic son, but yet he‚Äôs always had a calm approach regarding his families devastating situation, until today. \\nHe was crying when we spoke, my friend told him that she no longer loves him anymore &amp; to move out. My friend can barely speak, so her &amp; her husband have kind of developed a language all their own, but she can‚Äôt communicate enough to explain the reason behind her anger towards him. He knows it‚Äôs the illness speaking, but he told me that what really hurts is that she believes what she is saying at that moment. \\nShe‚Äôs had hallucinations before, but together we‚Äôve been kind of able to figure out where they were coming from, but we are both totally lost about this one. \\nI was hoping you had some ideas of how he can manage this situation with her. He‚Äôs her main care taker at home &amp; she‚Äôs so angry with him, that she won‚Äôt even look at him, where usually she‚Äôs very loving &amp; affectionate towards him. He‚Äôs really broken over this, so any ideas you have in dealing with this new behavior would be so very appreciated. \\nThanks for your time. \\nTake care,\\n Julie</td>\n",

He‚Äôd have some object in his hands and think maybe that would work as keys. Anyway, no he keeps trying to leave the house or from backyard. When we stop him he‚Äôs angry and verbally abusive. He will even take swings at us. He‚Äôs just so persistent and determined. We‚Äôre afraid to wheel him around in neighborhood because he may try to walk away and then he‚Äôs likely to fall and my mother and I can not lift though he‚Äôs only 150lbs. We‚Äôve tried redirecting but not your way, at least not me. I‚Äôll give a try and tell the other family members.\\nJust watched your video where you suggested changing environment. I‚Äôll give that a try, too. Maybe, I can hang a canvas over the gate, and place potted plants in front of. Thank you, for your channel. üòÅüëçüèºüòä</td>\n",

       "1253  This is taking over my neighbor at the moment- It started with him forgetting where stuff was and that we were helping him with stuff and it just- deteriorated. he started talking to people who werent there, trying to drive his Car to dead friends houses, And the straw that broke the camels back was when he called the police on a break in when it was me deilvering him some soup my mom had made him- that wasnt fun explaining to the sherriff what was going on. Finally he deteriorated so far he couldnt live alone, and his son put him in a home while he was renevating his house so he could take him back to live with him and his wife and kids. \\ni couldnt imagine a worst way for a decorated war hero to go. He was an PERSON, better at trapping than anyone i ever knew and was the staunchest old man i ever knew and i treated him like the grandfather i didnt have. Hopefully he will be back soon, living with his son in his old house, along side the only person he remembers, his son.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "37    Hi Dr. PERSON,\\nI‚Äôm so happy that I stumbled upon your channel. My best friend is suffering from early onset Alzheimer‚Äôs & going through your videos really helped me understand her situation a lot better. \\nI don‚Äôt live close to my friend, but am in contact with her wonderful husband through  phone calls & texts. Today we spoke & my heart broke for him. He is exhausted beyond belief between work, taking care of my friend & raising their autistic son, but yet he‚Äôs always had a calm approach regarding his families devastating situation, until today. \\nHe was crying when we spoke, my friend told him that she no longer loves him anymore & to move out. My friend can barely speak, so her & her husband have kind of developed a language all their own, but she can‚Äôt communicate enough to explain the reason behind her anger towards him. He knows it‚Äôs the illness speaking, but he told me that what really hurts is that she believes what she is saying at that moment. \\nShe‚Äôs had hallucinations before, but together we‚Äôve been kind of able to figure out where they were coming from, but we are both totally lost about this one. \\nI was hoping you had some ideas of how he can manage this situation with her. He‚Äôs her main care taker at home & she‚Äôs so angry with him, that she won‚Äôt even look at him, where usually she‚Äôs very loving & affectionate towards him. He‚Äôs really broken over this, so any ideas you have in dealing with this new behavior would be so very appreciated. \\nThanks for your time. \\nTake care,\\n Julie   \n",
       "150   At the very end of his life my father would show concern for a baby, which he thought was in the next room. I would always go and check on the 'baby' and tell him that the child was fine. Just a few days before he died, I asked him who the baby was, he said, \"It's you\". When I told him I was sitting in front of him and now a adult, he looked at me as if I was rather slow and said \"Yes I know that, but you are also the baby next door as well\".

I was telling her the truth and trying to reason with her but watching some of these videos I see I am supposed to go along with the delusion and redirect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "502   My father has recently declined, 2nd time had surgery for broken hip. He came back considerably weaker and his dementia has gotten considerably worse. Prior to this 2nd break he was driving still to get an afternoon coffee. That was ‚Äòpretty much it, just to the local McDonald‚Äôs.  But, now he‚Äôs pretty much limited to wheelchair, can only stand up to transfer from bed to chair. He‚Äôs not adjusting to not driving. He still thinks he can. We took the keys and had to move his car to my brothers because he kept going to it thinking he was going to go for a drive. He‚Äôd have some object in his hands and think maybe that would work as keys. Anyway, no he keeps trying to leave the house or from backyard. When we stop him he‚Äôs angry and verbally abusive. He will even take swings at us. He‚Äôs just so persistent and determined. We‚Äôre afraid to wheel him around in neighborhood because he may try to walk away and then he‚Äôs likely to fall and my mother and I can not lift though he‚Äôs only 150lbs. We‚Äôve tried redirecting but not your way, at least not me. I‚Äôll give a try and tell the other family members.\\nJust watched your video where you suggested changing environment. I‚Äôll give that a try, too. Maybe, I can hang a canvas over the gate, and place potted plants in front of.

       "549   My mother has trouble with sleeping. She says that we do things to her. She says she has no control over her finances, and her routines during the day. She also says we tell her doctor's lies about her health conditions. She is always mad, frustrated and always saying offensive things to us. We ignore all that. And get her off that subject. She'll be good for awhile. But will eventually go back to her angry mood again. We just don't know how to help her. But we will not give up.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
