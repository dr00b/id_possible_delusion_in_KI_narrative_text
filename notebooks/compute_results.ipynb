I remember he starting to forget everyone, however, more than forget, he usually took others as sombody that he previusly know, however, I was the only one that everyday, I was a stranger to himself. As his diseasess sarted to advance, it was clear that this month, was his last, however, an unexpected event happened. My other grandfather died suddenly, because of covid, I didn't even knew that he catched something and felt all surreal. The days passed and as well my grandpa with dementia, and... the first day I could handle the pain of all, the anxiety that I was coming through but one night I have a dream. It was simple, and even.. felt like a normal day, I went out with my friends, having a great time. However, when I got to my house, I found My grandfather, standing and smiling and the only thing that I did was hugging him. I swear that when I did that, I felt the warm of his body, and no long after, I woke up crying, without knowing what happened. After that magical event, I started to feel more relieved, at least, he wasn't living in that manner anymore and... That dream felt like the farewell that I needed. This video made me remember of that rough time, and the only thing that I can do is express my story and beeing up to help and listen all the families that are coming through this</td>\n",

He struggled with memory, concentration and had visual hallucinations early on the disease. We all thought it was stress from his job. He had to retire when he started having problems walking and started falling more often. At night he rummaged through drawers, had hallucinations of rabbits and people coming through walls, and had nightmares of witches chasing him. He only lived with the disease for 5 years before passing away last year. 😢</td>\n",

Instead I would say when she wanted me to take her \"home\" that I had to bring the car around and then leave. It was so hard and broke my heart to actually lie to her but it was the best I could do. She would of forgotten by the time I came back but still. Unfortunately for me I was going thru an illness that I no longer could work. .I didn't feel like driving.as much.. So I started calling her every morning. That worked out but I still tried to go see her.  She was about 1 1/2 hours away. My mom got very bad before she passed. She would be up all night and was trying to get out but luckily she was in a very secure place and they took very good care of her.

       "1196  PERSON quarantine was the worst time of my life, not only because I couldn't go out, because my granfather with alzheimer and cancer was on my house, and we were the only ones that for the previous 2 years could take care of him. I remember he starting to forget everyone, however, more than forget, he usually took others as sombody that he previusly know, however, I was the only one that everyday, I was a stranger to himself. As his diseasess sarted to advance, it was clear that this month, was his last, however, an unexpected event happened. My other grandfather died suddenly, because of covid, I didn't even knew that he catched something and felt all surreal. The days passed and as well my grandpa with dementia, and... the first day I could handle the pain of all, the anxiety that I was coming through but one night I have a dream. It was simple, and even.. felt like a normal day, I went out with my friends, having a great time. However, when I got to my house, I found My grandfather, standing and smiling and the only thing that I did was hugging him. I swear that when I did that, I felt the warm of his body, and no long after, I woke up crying, without knowing what happened. After that magical event, I started to feel more relieved, at least, he wasn't living in that manner anymore and... That dream felt like the farewell that I needed. This video made me remember of that rough time, and the only thing that I can do is express my story and beeing up to help and listen all the families that are coming through this   \n",

       "405   Oh my gosh - I was very new to nursing and had a lovely lady who asked me when her husband was going to visit. Sadly he had been dead for quite a while and in my wish to be truthful, told her so.  How I wish I hadn’t.  She became distressed and couldn’t believe I would tell such a cruel lie.  I never made that mistake again. Just a few minutes later, she asked the same question - thankfully this time I said simply “He’s coming in a bit later.”  I felt bad for lying but saving her from that moment of distress made up for that.  Oh, how I wish this channel existed 30 years ago! Thank you for posting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "484   My dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease and two years later, with dementia. After doing all my research and reading up on LBD, I strongly believe he had this disease. He struggled with memory, concentration and had visual hallucinations early on the disease. We all thought it was stress from his job. He had to retire when he started having problems walking and started falling more often. At night he rummaged through drawers, had hallucinations of rabbits and people coming through walls, and had nightmares of witches chasing him. He only lived with the disease for 5 years before passing away last year. 😢                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "653   Thank you. Great advice. What do you do when your spouse with dementia makes up wild mean stories about you and is on the phone complaining to his family? They never accepted his diagnosis and believe whatever he says. It just makes the whole caregiving situation so much more painful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1089  Wow what a great video about dementia.  I lost my mother 5 years ago to dementia.  All of this makes so much sense. I learned to talk about right now . I never would tell my mom no. Instead I would say when she wanted me to take her \"home\" that I had to bring the car around and then leave. It was so hard and broke my heart to actually lie to her but it was the best I could do. She would of forgotten by the time I came back but still. Unfortunately for me I was going thru an illness that I no longer could work. .I didn't feel like driving.as much.. So I started calling her every morning. That worked out but I still tried to go see her.  She was about 1 1/2 hours away. My mom got very bad before she passed. She would be up all night and was trying to get out but luckily she was in a very secure place and they took very good care of her. I recommend anyone with a loved one with dementia to watch this or really anyone who want to know more about dementia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1319  I love how you are showing people what its really like. My mother just died in April from covid in which one of the nurses brought in and dementia. My mom was just this bad. She would call me 9 times a day crying her eyes out wanting me to come and get her from the nursing home in which she called it the hospital.I love my mom dearly but it broke my heart to see her this way.May she rest In peace..i love my angel above.

I am 66 and she's 61. And it's going to really tough time period I'm. We don't know how much is stress n from the past duress. Worry and anxiety when she got Covid19 and forced a viction out of her home in the middle of December.  She's always had a little bit of comedy issues but nothing as much as she's had the past 6 months so had a sinus infection for 3 going on 4 months. The place she lived at she needed to move out of anyway because of the mold, mildew and debris from the duct work in the apartment. \\n She's now homeless and a homeless shelter and shelter and they're trying to figure out how to help her get to wherever she needs to go from here. She lost her job about 2 or 3 years ago I think it was. May have been 4 by now.\\n She has been laid up in her room or resting more the last 6 months probably than ever before in her life except for when she broke her leg. And both of us have been in 8 or 9 auto accidents throughout our lives and I know a couple of them were pretty bad and we've probably solved tissue brain damage or who knows what from the one in 92.  So now she's on medicaid and getting some care that she's been needing for a long time period she's got her eyeglasses and they just did a history scope DNC. Next step is going to be a colonoscopy, mammogram, finding an ear nose and throat doctor.  Once we take care of all of them what can be wrong physically and give her a couple of 2 to 4 months then we can maybe find out where she is cognitively and  brain-wise.  I keep telling her to mention to her counselors and the psychologist she has now that perhaps they should do a cat scan.  She could simply have some sort of weak vessels bleeding on the brain going on. Our mother died at the age of 61 from like an aneurysm, even though that's not what they called it.  Set some sort of bleeding on the brain. Perhaps a stroke. (Her head fell into her cup of coffee at McDonald's one morning.)  She's concerned that something like that might be going on and they're not going to find out until it's too late.</td>\n",

My best friend is suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s &amp; going through your videos really helped me understand her situation a lot better. \\nI don’t live close to my friend, but am in contact with her wonderful husband through  phone calls &amp; texts. Today we spoke &amp; my heart broke for him. He is exhausted beyond belief between work, taking care of my friend &amp; raising their autistic son, but yet he’s always had a calm approach regarding his families devastating situation, until today. \\nHe was crying when we spoke, my friend told him that she no longer loves him anymore &amp; to move out. My friend can barely speak, so her &amp; her husband have kind of developed a language all their own, but she can’t communicate enough to explain the reason behind her anger towards him. He knows it’s the illness speaking, but he told me that what really hurts is that she believes what she is saying at that moment. \\nShe’s had hallucinations before, but together we’ve been kind of able to figure out where they were coming from, but we are both totally lost about this one. \\nI was hoping you had some ideas of how he can manage this situation with her. He’s her main care taker at home &amp; she’s so angry with him, that she won’t even look at him, where usually she’s very loving &amp; affectionate towards him. He’s really broken over this, so any ideas you have in dealing with this new behavior would be so very appreciated. \\nThanks for your time. \\nTake care,\\n Julie</td>\n",

       "1253  This is taking over my neighbor at the moment- It started with him forgetting where stuff was and that we were helping him with stuff and it just- deteriorated. he started talking to people who werent there, trying to drive his Car to dead friends houses, And the straw that broke the camels back was when he called the police on a break in when it was me deilvering him some soup my mom had made him- that wasnt fun explaining to the sherriff what was going on. Finally he deteriorated so far he couldnt live alone, and his son put him in a home while he was renevating his house so he could take him back to live with him and his wife and kids. \\ni couldnt imagine a worst way for a decorated war hero to go. He was an PERSON, better at trapping than anyone i ever knew and was the staunchest old man i ever knew and i treated him like the grandfather i didnt have. Hopefully he will be back soon, living with his son in his old house, along side the only person he remembers, his son.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "278   At this moment, with my Mom ( 89 ) I would welcome her not knowing me. That may sound cruel. She has mostly short term memory problems and I am extremely patient - asking the same thing about 7 times in a row. I always answer her as if it the first time she has asked. \\n\\nBut she has always been critical of me as being “ lazy “ ( I was depressed as a teenager, but that does not exist in her old Slavic world ) \\nI am a mother of 4 and was a mother to my granddaughter as well. \\nI was extremely hardworking and became an athlete as well. \\nBut 8 years ago, I developed a disorder called ME/CFS - unfortunately, no biomarker and not studied in Med school. \\nFor four years - from 64 to 67 - I was bedbound. To my Mom, laziness and no note from any Dr. - illness is invalid. \\nThe lectures I received and still receive are exhausting. I had to stay away for 2 weeks for my health. BTW, 8 siblings were all here at our lake from all over N. America. So no lack of help. \\n\\nNow if this were my sister or husband, I would find them not knowing me heartbreaking and I would be glad of these wonderful strategies. \\nBut at the moment, no. I have spent so much of my life being criticized, I could finally do without it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "85    I just wanted to say thank you for this video presentation and explanation of dementia. Sometimes I wonder if I'm getting it myself already.  And yet I know there's other things that play into this and it may not be that at all yet. And I know I need to take steps to make sure I can delay that as long as possible.\\n\\n Now that I've said that what I'm really concerned about is my sister who is 5 years younger than myself. I am 66 and she's 61. And it's going to really tough time period I'm. We don't know how much is stress n from the past duress. Worry and anxiety when she got Covid19 and forced a viction out of her home in the middle of December.  She's always had a little bit of comedy issues but nothing as much as she's had the past 6 months so had a sinus infection for 3 going on 4 months. The place she lived at she needed to move out of anyway because of the mold, mildew and debris from the duct work in the apartment. \\n She's now homeless and a homeless shelter and shelter and they're trying to figure out how to help her get to wherever she needs to go from here. She lost her job about 2 or 3 years ago I think it was. May have been 4 by now.\\n She has been laid up in her room or resting more the last 6 months probably than ever before in her life except for when she broke her leg. And both of us have been in 8 or 9 auto accidents throughout our lives and I know a couple of them were pretty bad and we've probably solved tissue brain damage or who knows what from the one in 92.  So now she's on medicaid and getting some care that she's been needing for a long time period she's got her eyeglasses and they just did a history scope DNC. Next step is going to be a colonoscopy, mammogram, finding an ear nose and throat doctor.  Once we take care of all of them what can be wrong physically and give her a couple of 2 to 4 months then we can maybe find out where she is cognitively and  brain-wise.  I keep telling her to mention to her counselors and the psychologist she has now that perhaps they should do a cat scan.  She could simply have some sort of weak vessels bleeding on the brain going on. Our mother died at the age of 61 from like an aneurysm, even though that's not what they called it.  Set some sort of bleeding on the brain. Perhaps a stroke. (Her head fell into her cup of coffee at McDonald's one morning.)  She's concerned that something like that might be going on and they're not going to find out until it's too late.   \n",
       "37    Hi Dr. PERSON,\\nI’m so happy that I stumbled upon your channel. My best friend is suffering from early onset Alzheimer’s & going through your videos really helped me understand her situation a lot better. \\nI don’t live close to my friend, but am in contact with her wonderful husband through  phone calls & texts. Today we spoke & my heart broke for him. He is exhausted beyond belief between work, taking care of my friend & raising their autistic son, but yet he’s always had a calm approach regarding his families devastating situation, until today. \\nHe was crying when we spoke, my friend told him that she no longer loves him anymore & to move out. My friend can barely speak, so her & her husband have kind of developed a language all their own, but she can’t communicate enough to explain the reason behind her anger towards him. He knows it’s the illness speaking, but he told me that what really hurts is that she believes what she is saying at that moment. \\nShe’s had hallucinations before, but together we’ve been kind of able to figure out where they were coming from, but we are both totally lost about this one. \\nI was hoping you had some ideas of how he can manage this situation with her. He’s her main care taker at home & she’s so angry with him, that she won’t even look at him, where usually she’s very loving & affectionate towards him. He’s really broken over this, so any ideas you have in dealing with this new behavior would be so very appreciated. \\nThanks for your time. \\nTake care,\\n Julie                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "608   I just found this channel. My 80 year old mom Is seeing people that are not there. And her favorite delusion is that she does not live in this house with me that she lives in another house down the street and wants to go home all the time. She gets to the point where she bundles all her stuff up and gets ready to go.

       "502   My father has recently declined, 2nd time had surgery for broken hip. He came back considerably weaker and his dementia has gotten considerably worse. Prior to this 2nd break he was driving still to get an afternoon coffee. That was ‘pretty much it, just to the local McDonald’s.  But, now he’s pretty much limited to wheelchair, can only stand up to transfer from bed to chair. He’s not adjusting to not driving. He still thinks he can. We took the keys and had to move his car to my brothers because he kept going to it thinking he was going to go for a drive. He’d have some object in his hands and think maybe that would work as keys. Anyway, no he keeps trying to leave the house or from backyard. When we stop him he’s angry and verbally abusive. He will even take swings at us. He’s just so persistent and determined. We’re afraid to wheel him around in neighborhood because he may try to walk away and then he’s likely to fall and my mother and I can not lift though he’s only 150lbs. We’ve tried redirecting but not your way, at least not me. I’ll give a try and tell the other family members.\\nJust watched your video where you suggested changing environment. I’ll give that a try, too. Maybe, I can hang a canvas over the gate, and place potted plants in front of.

       "549   My mother has trouble with sleeping. She says that we do things to her. She says she has no control over her finances, and her routines during the day. She also says we tell her doctor's lies about her health conditions. She is always mad, frustrated and always saying offensive things to us. We ignore all that. And get her off that subject. She'll be good for awhile. But will eventually go back to her angry mood again. We just don't know how to help her.

She had to be watched 24/7 cause she would forget very fast where she was and leave the house banging on ppls door for her medicine..... she ended up having a heart attack and when we took her to the hospital it was kinda like having some time off cause she doesn’t sleep so she’s up all night and someone has to be up with her so when she was at the hospital the doctors kept calling us and was basically begging for us to stay with her cause she was screaming for her medicine and saying she was in Puerto Rico (where she originally lives) and plus no one spoke Spanish so no one really understood her...... my boyfriend was with her the whole time with her but when he lefted for only 30 minutes that’s when the doctors called (cause I don’t want ppl to think we let her go to the hospital and didn’t care my boyfriend didn’t want me to go and went by himself he was there all day then came home at 4 in the morning) but yea I even touched her medicine bag to move it to the side cause I was eating then she started to say i was stealing her medicine and was threatening to hit me and was saying for me to leave her house and live on the street cause I was a thief... again she’s in my house but I never got upset cause she would forget in 20 minutes what happen it’s not her fault....but it’s very sad what the brain can do as u get older I only wish her the best I still love her no matter what I no she doesn’t mean it.....</td>\n",

       "1160  My mother in law has dementia I didn’t no how bad it was cause my grandma had minor episodes most that I wasn’t there for to see personally but when my mother in law came to stay for the week it was the longest week of my life she kept taking her medicine every hour thinking she hasn’t takin anything so we took her medicine before she overdosed herself and gave them to her, we would just eat from Taco Bell and then when we get home and she’s starting to cook and I’m like mom we just ate and she gets very offensive saying NOOOO I DIDNT EAT ALL DAY WHAT U SAYING THAT IM CRAZY!!!!... it got to the point where she got very violent and screaming for us to get out her house when she was in our house..... She had to be watched 24/7 cause she would forget very fast where she was and leave the house banging on ppls door for her medicine..... she ended up having a heart attack and when we took her to the hospital it was kinda like having some time off cause she doesn’t sleep so she’s up all night and someone has to be up with her so when she was at the hospital the doctors kept calling us and was basically begging for us to stay with her cause she was screaming for her medicine and saying she was in Puerto Rico (where she originally lives) and plus no one spoke Spanish so no one really understood her...... my boyfriend was with her the whole time with her but when he lefted for only 30 minutes that’s when the doctors called (cause I don’t want ppl to think we let her go to the hospital and didn’t care my boyfriend didn’t want me to go and went by himself he was there all day then came home at 4 in the morning) but yea I even touched her medicine bag to move it to the side cause I was eating then she started to say i was stealing her medicine and was threatening to hit me and was saying for me to leave her house and live on the street cause I was a thief... again she’s in my house but I never got upset cause she would forget in 20 minutes what happen it’s not her fault....but it’s very sad what the brain can do as u get older I only wish her the best I still love her no matter what I no she doesn’t mean it.....   \n",
       "735   My mother's father was at the hospital this past couple of weeks.  Now, he is in an ALTEC Care place.  The challenge I, my mom, and my grandmother have been facing is getting him to drink his Ensure drink.  The challenge arises when he NEEDS to keep drinking, because he has to have a certain amount of protein to feel better, but he doesn't want to keep drinking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
