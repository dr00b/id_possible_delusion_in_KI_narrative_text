How do I handle my husband who does not remember that he's eaten and keeps asking for food? He keeps going to the fridge and pantry and munches on things.  I've tried telling him that he just had his breakfast or lunch and I'll give him dinner soon, but he still wants something to eat - usually sweet stuff.  Because he is diabetic, I have to limit his carbs, and it's so hard,  Do I have to get rid of everything from his sight? \\nAlso, he is not active at all. He will sleep on his recliner the whole day.  I force him to walk (in the mall when cold and outside when warm) every day, which he very reluctantly will do.  However, as soon as we get to the mall, he is always hungry and I have to buy him some food.  Is there a disconnect from the brain to his stomach that does not tell him that he's full?\\nRegina\", 0, 'Kumon Accountant', 'UCEEC6XgdvvN8j0kp3p6CBew', 'UCEEC6XgdvvN8j0kp3p6CBew', '2023-02-08T20:16:12Z', '2023-02-08T20:16:12Z', 0, 0)\n",
