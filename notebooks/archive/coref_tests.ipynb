    "# Untested Assumptions\n",
    "1. Given sample of videos and channels, comments relate primarily to dementia, even if a dementia specific keyword is not used explicitly.\n",
    "2. Comments are from real, knowledgeble informants, rather than bots or sarcastic posters\n",
    "3. Commenters statements are truthful. For example, many delusions experienced by dementia patients relate to infidelity or theft. If a commenter asserts the dementia patient's claims are false, assume they are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 1 - Motivating Examples:\n",
    "In the following comment, user responds to the content of the video, which outlined strategies for addressing delusions in dementia patients. The commenter never explicitly mentions dementia however.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'm finding myself in more and more situations, where being honest with my loved one just makes matters worse.  There are times when he appears to have presence of mind and a pretty good understanding of reality.  It's during those episodes of clarity, when he tends to make statements or ask questions.  Where I find my replies of truth to be  like walking into a trap.  As if I just opened Pandora's box to his pent up hostility, anger and verbal abuse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes deception is not only to protect the feelings of the patient with dementia.  Sometimes  deception is necessary to  protect the caregivers.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in the following comment, there is no discussion of dementia as a condition, or an underlying pathology. Based on context and knowledge of video content, it's clear the commenter is describing an individual with dementia.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thank you for your videos.  The situation with my mom is now that she is older and has thinner skin she gets really cold.  She doesn’t believe this is why she gets colder.  She insists that we are the only people that has a cold house. Our temp is set around 72 or 73 degrees.  She says everyone else keeps there house temp at 80 degrees and she insists that we kept the house temp at 80 degrees year round for our whole lives.  Ex:  When my parents were in their 30’s and I was a young child she claims our house temp was always set at 80 degrees.  If you tell her it was not and that she gets colder now because of her age she gets really mad.  I should also mention this is not a once in a while conversation she has.  She talks about this multiple times every day.\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Assumption 2 - Motivating Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumption 3 - Motivating Examples:\n",
    "There is no way to adjudicate truth in the following case. It's possible that the commentor (child) is unaware of their father's past history of infidelity. On the other hand, delusions relating to infidelity are common in dementia patients. For the purposes of classifying \"possible delusion\", we assume the knowledgable informant is correct.\n",
    "```\n",
    "My mom keeps thinking my father is out and about cheating on her, and mom sees him 24 hours a day.  He never goes out, but she still keeps thinking that.  Mom would confront dad, and of course he is not out cheating on her.  I honestly don't know how to handle this situation.\n",

The only answers I got were no one really knows how no one works. Through your videos I was more able to help I Mother and I self. I really appreciate your being there for I. I kept a journal of I journey with I Mother. I found playing games with my Mother a great help when my Mother had a bad day. When my Mother didn't want to take a bath or get up to go to the bathroom, I would play a game, we would go to the bathroom and quack and walk like a duck. I would make up silly games to get my Mother to eat. The hardest part for I was when hospice came in and my Mother finally could not walk and my Mother ended up in a hospital bed. I still played games with my Mother to get what little bit of food I could get in my Mother. I tried to make every day count. I still miss my Mother but when my Mother left I, I was glad for my Mother. my Mother will never hurt or suffer again. I know my Mother was happy because my Mother wanted to be with I Father. Tomorrow my Father will be gone for 4yrs. I took care of my Father when my Father had bladder cancer.  I lived with I parents for 10 yrs and I am so thankful my Father gave I that time.  I hope each and every one who is taking care of a love one has the precious memories I have and enjoys their special time with their. Thank I so much for I help and my Father bless I!\n"
