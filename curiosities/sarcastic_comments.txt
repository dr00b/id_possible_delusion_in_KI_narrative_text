So if my loved one accuses me of stealing her expensive painting (what really happened to it, I don't know)  I should tell her not to worry, yes I stole it, and then I should reassure her that I will bring it back? Then what do I say to them when the police show up at my door, and my loved one is there and tells them that I admitted stealing it. Last time something like this happened I told the police my loved one has dementia, and has delusions, but they arrested me anyway. I told them well yes, I admitted stealing it, to her, not to you, because someone on youtube told me to admit it, even though I didn't actually steal it. That was more complicated than they were able to understand. Thank goodness my loved one couldn't find t the documents that showed when she bought the painting and how much she paid for it. So the DA dropped the case. But I had to spend the weekend in jail, and pay $600 to a lawyer.
